# Projects Directory

This directory contains all individual frontend projects.

## Structure

Each project should be in its own subdirectory with the following structure:

```
project-name/
├── README.md           # Project documentation
├── src/               # Source code
├── public/            # Public assets
├── package.json       # Dependencies (if applicable)
└── ...                # Other project files
```

## Adding a New Project

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Add your project files
3. Include a comprehensive README.md with:
   - Project title and description
   - Technologies/frameworks used
   - Installation instructions
   - Usage guide
   - Screenshots or demo links
   - License information

Coming soon! Projects will be added here over time.
