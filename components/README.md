# Components Directory

This directory contains shared, reusable components that can be used across multiple projects.

## Structure

Components are organized by type or framework:

```
components/
├── react/             # React components
├── vue/              # Vue components
├── vanilla/          # Vanilla JavaScript components
└── css/              # CSS components and utilities
```

## Component Guidelines

Each component should:
- Be self-contained and reusable
- Include clear documentation
- Have example usage code
- Follow consistent coding standards

## Usage

Components can be copied into your projects or used as reference implementations.
